# Minimify 🦇

Minimify is an early-stage Spotify clone, designed to push my development skills to new heights. This project is a personal challenge inspired by boredom, and I aim to create more advanced applications than I’ve previously tackled. Best of all, Minimify will be fully open-source, so feel free to fork it and contribute!

## Goals 📈

- Allow users to log in using their Spotify accounts.
- Provide an ad-free listening experience.
- Feature a sleek, minimalistic design.
- Develop an Electron-based version for Windows.

## Tools & Frameworks Used 👴🏻

- [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs) - for building user interfaces.
- [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) - for styling and layout.
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - for robust type safety.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - for making HTTP requests.
